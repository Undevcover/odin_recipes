    <h2>How to make this irresistible pasta</h2>
    <p>There are two types of pasta, the ones that my grandmother makes, and others. This is your last stop for pasta recipes, trust me.</p>
    <p>I'm going to be taking you through a step-by-step process of making my grandmother's pasta</p>

    <p>I'm kidding. my grandmother never made pasta. In fact, she hated it</p>
    <p>She found it very unsightly. She couldn't even stand the sight of anyone while they're eating it. 
    <p>Being someone who saw many <em>Ascaris lumbricoides </em>throughout her life, it's quite understandable.</p> 
    <p>I mean, spaghetti looks like skinny Ascaris and that's quite creepy. But I still love this it.</p>
    <p>I don't mind eating the intestinal parasite too it it would taste like this. I'm kidding, again.</p>
    <p>I probably shouldn't be talking aout Ascaris now, right? my bad.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Slim Spaghetti   500g</li>
        <li>Tomatoes         100g</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <p>Here are the steps you need to meake this hearty meal. Feel free to modify the peppers to your taste. </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil your spaghetti till it's moderately soft, not too soft</li>
        <li>Blend your tomatoes, 2 of the onions, one large red bell pepper, and your peppers. I like to add a lot of pepper, because what's the point if I don't pass out?</li>
        <li>Chop the remaining onions as you like and add them to olive oil in a pan on the fire.</li>
