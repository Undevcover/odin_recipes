Hello. This is my first github html project. 
I'm hoping to be able to get a good grasp of how github works and be able to use terminal properly. so far, so good
I don't think HTML is anything to worry about, so, we'll see how it goes after i create the odin_recipes html file. So help me God.

I am not good at writing, but i really poured my heart into writing this recipes. hopefully, you will cherish them as much as i do.
